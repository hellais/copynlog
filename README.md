# CopyNLog

Quick and simple piece of code to copy music to my sandisk music player and
keep a log of it.

# Usage

## On OSX

Open a terminal and run


### Step 1

```
git clone https://github.com/hellais/copynlog.git
cd copynlog
./copynlog.py
```

### Step 2

Then drag and drop the directories of music you want to copy.


### Step 3

Drag and drop the target SD card drive to the terminal.

### Done

You should now have in your current working directory (you can see this by
running `pwd` from terminal or running `open .` to open it in the finder) a
file called `SOMETHING.md` where `SOMETHING` is the name of the partition.
